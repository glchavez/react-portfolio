# react-portfolio

This portfolio was created to update my first portfolio by using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This portfolio has an "About Me" page, "Portfolio" page, and "Contact" page. A key update to this portfolio is a functioning contact form.

## Overview

In addition to being a website to display my current projects and knowledge in web development, this portfolio tested my knowledge of React.js.

The website contains an "About Me" page with a short bio of myself, a "Portfolio" page to display my completed projects, and a "Contact" page if anyone desires to reach out. SendGrid was the initial plan to implement a functioning contact form, but that did not work as SendGrid cannot send emails when implemented in a frontend program like React. After research, EmailJS was used to get the contact form working.

I would like to continue editing this website as I learn more about React and implement the powerful tools that React can power.

To view the current website, please click on the following link: [Giovany's Portfolio](https://glchavez.github.io/react-portfolio/)


## Usage

On top of the each web page there is a navigation bar with three links: About, Portfolio, and Contact. When clicked, these links will take you to their respective web pages, as shown in the images below. On the Contact web page, you can fill out the three text boxes to submit a request for contact. This will send an email to me with your information.

## Credits

I would like to provide credit to [The Denver Univeristy Coding Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.du.edu/coding/) for providing me with the materials and intstructions to perform this project.

I would also like to recognize [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) for providing documents on how to create a form that sends an email when submitted through a React App.
